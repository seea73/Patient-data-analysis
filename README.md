# Patient Data Understanding â€“ Mini Data Project

This repository contains the final project for the course **Patient Data Understanding (DA 03510)**. The objective was to demonstrate knowledge of healthcare data collection, cleaning, analysis, and reporting using real-world medical or research datasets.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To apply the principles of healthcare data management and analysis by:
- Selecting relevant patient or medical data
- Cleaning and wrangling the data for analysis
- Performing exploratory and statistical analysis
- Drawing insights using visualizations and/or machine learning techniques

---

## ðŸ©º Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is related to healthcare/medical research. It contains **at least 100 rows and 5+ variables**, providing insights into patients laboratory test results used to determine next patient treatment whether in care or out care patient.

**Source**: (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7kv3rctx7m/1) 
**Format**: CSV

## ðŸ§¼ Data Preparation

The following data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed:
- Removed unnecessary or empty columns
- Handled missing values
- Standardized categorical variables
- Created new indicators (e.g., risk levels, groupings)

---

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

Ten key questions were formulated to explore trends and relationships within the dataset, such as:

- Is there any gender imbalance in the dataset? 
- Which lab features (like HAEMATOCRIT, HAEMOGLOBINS, etc.) show skewed distributions? 
- Are there significant differences in lab features between In-care and Out-care patients? 

Statistical methods and/or basic machine learning techniques were used for analysis.  
**Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
